        "# Introduction to Deep Learning Using Keras\n",
        "\n",
        "[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high-level API for deep learning. It is written in Python, and can run on top of [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), two very popular libraries for neural networks in Python. It allows users to implement deep learning models very fast and with minimum effort. In the past years, the contribution of Keras to research in deep learning has been significant since it has allowed researchers to go from ideas to results with the least possible delay.\n",

Your first objective is to create this dataset. It will consist of 200 points in the 2-dimensional space $(N = 200, d = 2)$. Each point will belong either to class 0 or to class 1 (100 points per class), drawn from a Gaussian distribution: \n",
